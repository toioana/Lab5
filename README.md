# Lab5

I had challenges finishing up the first 6 exercises because I had a hard time understanding what I had to do so it took a long time to 
finish them and just gave up (after almost 3 hours). The previous labs were quite clear and easy to understand and a really nice way 
to learn new things (I was actually really happy I managed to do them), but this one was difficult and really frustrating.
